# **Custom TCP Messaging Protocol**

## **Overview**

This project is focused on building a high-performance, custom **TCP messaging protocol** designed for **efficient serialization and deserialization** of data. The primary goal is to create a **Java-based protocol** that can handle complex data structures with minimal overhead and provide a flexible framework for future cross-platform communication.

### **Core Features**
- **Custom Protocol**: Develop a custom binary-based messaging protocol optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Use **Kryo** for high-performance serialization and deserialization of complex objects.
- **TCP Communication**: Establish reliable, low-latency communication over TCP using **Vert.x** as the runtime environment.
- **Protocol Expansion**: Initially focused on a Java-only implementation but with future plans to support **cross-platform compatibility** (e.g., via JSON or other serializers).

## **Current Plan**
1. **Phase 1**:
    - Implement the core **TCP server** using **Vert.x** for handling connections and managing protocol messages.
    - Integrate **Kryo** for efficient binary serialization/deserialization of Java objects.
    - Develop basic message structures to communicate between a server and client.

2. **Phase 2**:
    - Extend the system to allow for **cross-platform communication** (support for JSON and other serialization formats).
    - Add more advanced protocol features (e.g., message fragmentation, encryption, versioning).

3. **Phase 3**:
    - Continue optimizing for performance, scaling up to handle more complex message types, error handling, and concurrency.
